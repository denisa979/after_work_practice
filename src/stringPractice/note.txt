StringBuffer is thread-safe due to synchronized methods, so its output is consistent.

String and StringBuilder are not thread-safe; their output may be inconsistent due to race conditions.
The expected length is the sum of all appended numbers' digit counts (not exactly 2000, since numbers have varying digit lengths).

Use StringBuffer for thread safety in concurrent scenarios

StringBuilder, StringBuffer, Stack methods:

append(String str): Adds the given text to the end of the current text and records it for possible undo.

undo(): Removes the last appended text, reverting the text to its previous state.

getText(): Returns the current text as a string.

push(E item): Adds (pushes) an item onto the top of the stack.

pop(): Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.

peek(): Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
