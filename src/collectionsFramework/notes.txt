COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK

HashMap
HashMap is a class from the Java Collections Framework that implements the Map interface. It
stores key-value pairs and allows fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion based on keys. Keys are
unique, and each key maps to exactly one value, making HashMap ideal for associative arrays or dictionary-like data structures.

ArrayList
ArrayList is a class from the Java Collections Framework that implements the List interface.It
maintains an ordered, resizable array of elements, allowing fast random access and dynamic resizing. ArrayList is ideal for lists where frequent retrieval and iteration are needed.

LinkedList
LinkedList is a class that implements the List and Deque interfaces. It uses a doubly-linked list structure, providing efficient insertion and removal at both ends, and supports ordered iteration. LinkedList is suitable for queues, stacks, and situations with frequent modifications.

HashSet
HashSet is a class that implements the Set interface and is backed by a hash table.
It stores unique elements without duplicates and offers constant-time performance for add, remove, and contains operations, making it effective for membership testing.

LinkedHashSet 
LinkedHashMap is a class in the Java Collections Framework.
It maintains the insertion order of its entries (ordered by how keys were added).
Keys in a LinkedHashMap are unique, it does not accept duplicate keys. Each key maps to one value.
LinkedHashMap implements the Map interface and extends the HashMap class.

TreeSet
TreeSet is a class that implements the NavigableSet interface. It is backed by a red-black tree, storing elements in sorted order with no duplicates, and provides efficient operations for
accessing elements based on their ordering.

PriorityQueue
PriorityQueue is a class that implements the Queue interface. It orders elements according to their natural ordering or a specified comparator, allowing efficient access to the smallest or
highest-priority element, commonly used in scheduling and graph algorithms.

HashBag
HashBag is a class from the Apache Commons Collections library that implements the Bag interface a collection type that allows duplicate
elements and tracks their frequency. It is designed to handle multiple
occurrences of the same element, making it ideal for tasks involving frequency counting.

- It works like a multiset: you can add elements, and it counts how many times each appears.
- You can query the count of any element.
- Useful for frequency counting tasks.
 We need to add dependency to POM.XML file:
 
 <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-collections4</artifactId>
    <version>4.4</version>
</dependency>

 Or if we work with Java without Maven then we can download binary JAR file from Apache Commons Collections.
 Extract file and add it to your project library under Java.

Go to File > Project Structure > Libraries.
Click the + button and choose Java.
Select the downloaded JAR file.
Apply and OK.
This makes org.apache.commons.collections4.bag.HashBag available for
import in your .java source files.
